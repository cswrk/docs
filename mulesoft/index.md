## General Concepts

### ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)
An ESB is a mediating layer connecting independent pieces of software. These apps often use different protocols. Consequently, the ESB will take care of transforming and routing the data. This allows for the creation of decoupled services. Therefore, each service does not need to worry about how another service will consume its output.
